# Hand-Gesture-Classification-using-EMG-data
We obtained EMG data from UCI Repository. We have developed several classical ML and neural network models on the dataset.

Data Description:
In this study, EMG data was recorded for a total of 36 subjects. The data was collected using a MYO Thalamic bracelet, which was equipped with 8 sensors that were equally spaced around the forearm. The sensors were designed to measure the electrical activity of the muscles during the performance of hand gestures. The EMG signals from these sensors were transmitted to a PC via Bluetooth. During the data collection process, each subject was asked to perform a series of 7 basic hand gestures. These gestures were carefully selected to be representative of a wide range of hand movements commonly used in daily life. Each gesture was performed for a period of 3 seconds, with a pause of 3 seconds between two gestures. This was done to ensure that the data captured for each gesture was sufficient for analysis and to minimize the potential for muscle fatigue.
